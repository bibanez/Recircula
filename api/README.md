Code for the app developed for the Recircula challenge 2022.
This app is designed to initiate a movement and allow for food wasted reduction in the household scale. It is one I have presented in the Recircula challenge final with my team.
This folder includes the design of a search algorithm for recipe recommendation given a set of ingredients with their respective quantities based on the give data set from Recipe_DB.
The implementation of the recommendation includes a priority queue using heaps, that allows an for an efficient search. Try it out for yourself!
